### 2. Problem Statement

* The current project's testing framework (PHPUnit) is not aligned with the architectural specification, leading to inconsistency and missing out on the benefits of a more modern and expressive testing tool.

---

### 3. Business Objective(s)

*   **Objective 1:** Achieve full compliance with the project's architectural specification regarding the testing framework.
*   **Objective 2:** Enhance developer experience and test readability by adopting Pest.

### 4. Core User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

#### Feature: Test Framework Transition

*   **US-001:** As a developer, I want all existing PHPUnit tests to be migrated to Pest syntax so that the project uses a consistent and modern testing framework.
    *   **AC-001.1: Scenario:** Successful migration of a unit test
        *   **Given** an existing PHPUnit unit test file
        *   **When** the test is converted to Pest syntax
        *   **Then** the converted test runs successfully
        *   **And** the test output is clear and readable.
    *   **AC-001.2: Scenario:** Successful migration of a feature test
        *   **Given** an existing PHPUnit feature test file
        *   **When** the test is converted to Pest syntax
        *   **Then** the converted test runs successfully
        *   **And** the test interacts with the application as expected.

*   **US-002:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to execute Pest tests so that automated quality checks reflect the new testing framework.
    *   **AC-002.1: Scenario:** CI job runs Pest
        *   **Given** a pull request is opened
        *   **When** the CI pipeline runs the testing job
        *   **Then** `./vendor/bin/pest` command is executed
        *   **And** the CI job passes if all tests pass.

*   **US-003:** As a project contributor, I want the project documentation to reflect the use of Pest so that I can easily understand how to run tests.
    *   **AC-003.1: Scenario:** README updated
        *   **Given** I read the `README.md`
        *   **When** I look for instructions on running tests
        *   **Then** the instructions specify `./vendor/bin/pest`.
    *   **AC-003.2: Scenario:** CONTRIBUTING guide updated
        *   **Given** I read the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
        *   **When** I look for the mandatory pre-PR quality checklist
        *   **Then** the checklist specifies `./vendor/bin/pest` for running tests.

### 5. Scope Boundaries

#### In Scope

*   Migration of all existing PHPUnit unit and feature tests to Pest.
*   Updating `phpunit.xml` for Pest compatibility.
*   Updating `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run Pest.
*   Updating `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect Pest usage.

#### Out of Scope

*   Writing new tests beyond the migration of existing ones.
*   Refactoring of existing test logic unless required for Pest compatibility.
*   Deep refactoring of application code to facilitate testing.

---

### 6. Assumptions & Constraints

#### Assumptions

*   Pest is compatible with the current PHP and Laravel versions.
*   Existing test logic can be directly translated to Pest syntax without significant re-architecture.
*   The project team has basic familiarity with Pest or is willing to learn.

#### Constraints

*   The transition must not introduce regressions in existing functionality.
*   The CI pipeline must remain functional throughout the transition.
