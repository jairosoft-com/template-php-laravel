# **Technical Implementation Details: REQ-008**

## **Requirement: Update PHP and Laravel Versions**

> **User Story:** As a developer, I want the project's `composer.json` file updated to require PHP `8.3` and Laravel `12.x` so that it uses modern, supported versions.

---

### **Objective**

To upgrade the project's core dependencies to the versions specified in the project standards document. This is a critical step for long-term security, performance, and access to modern language and framework features.

**This is a significant and potentially breaking change.** It should be performed on a dedicated branch and tested thoroughly.

### **Implementation Steps**

1.  **Review Laravel Upgrade Guide:**
    *   Before making any changes, thoroughly read the official Laravel Upgrade Guide for upgrading from Laravel 11 to Laravel 12. Pay close attention to any "high" impact changes.
    *   Also, review the release notes for PHP 8.3 to understand new features and potential backward-compatibility breaks.

2.  **Update `composer.json`:**
    *   Open the `composer.json` file.
    *   Modify the `require` section to update the PHP and framework versions.
    *   **Modification in `composer.json`:**
        ```json
        "require": {
            "php": "^8.3",
            "laravel/framework": "^12.0",
            // ... other dependencies
        },
        ```

3.  **Update Other Laravel Packages:**
    *   Update the versions of other first-party Laravel packages to ensure compatibility with Laravel 12. This includes packages like `laravel/pint`, `laravel/sail`, `laravel/tinker`, etc. Check their respective documentation for compatible version constraints.
    *   **Example:**
        ```json
        "require-dev": {
            "laravel/pint": "^2.0",
            "laravel/sail": "^2.0",
            // ...
        }
        ```

4.  **Update Third-Party Dependencies:**
    *   Review all other packages in `composer.json`. Check their documentation or Packagist listing to find versions that are compatible with Laravel 12 and PHP 8.3. Update the version constraints accordingly.

5.  **Run Composer Update:**
    *   Execute the `composer update` command to download the new package versions. This command will resolve all dependencies based on the new constraints.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        composer update
        ```
    *   Address any dependency conflicts that arise. This may involve finding alternative packages or waiting for maintainers to release compatible versions.

6.  **Codebase Updates:**
    *   Based on the Laravel Upgrade Guide, make any necessary changes to the application's code. This could involve updating method signatures, changing configuration files, or replacing deprecated features.

7.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   After the upgrade is complete and the application runs without immediate errors, run the entire test suite.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        ./vendor/bin/pest
        ```
    *   Manually test the application's key features in a browser to catch any issues not covered by automated tests.

### **Verification**

1.  The `composer.json` file reflects the new version constraints (`"php": "^8.3"`, `"laravel/framework": "^12.0"`).
2.  The `composer.lock` file has been updated, and the installed versions of the packages match the new requirements.
3.  The command `php artisan --version` shows that the application is running Laravel `12.x.x`.
4.  The command `php --version` in the application's environment shows `8.3.x`.
5.  The entire test suite passes.
6.  The application is fully functional when tested manually.

### **Risks and Mitigation**

*   **Risk:** **High.** A major dependency upgrade has a high likelihood of introducing breaking changes, dependency conflicts, or subtle bugs.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Dedicated Branch:** Perform the entire upgrade on a separate feature branch. Do not commit it to `main` or `develop` until it is fully tested and verified.
        *   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** A robust and comprehensive test suite is the single most important mitigation factor. Ensure test coverage is high *before* attempting the upgrade.
        *   **Incremental Updates:** If possible, update dependencies in smaller batches rather than all at once to make it easier to isolate the source of any problems.
        *   **Pair Programming:** Perform the upgrade with another developer to have a second set of eyes on the code and documentation.
