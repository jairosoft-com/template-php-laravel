# **Technical Implementation Details: REQ-004**

## **Requirement: Configure Laravel Pint**

> **User Story:** As a developer, I want Laravel Pint configured with a `pint.json` file so that all code is automatically formatted to the PSR-12 standard.

---

### **Objective**

To install and configure Laravel Pint, the official PHP code style fixer for Laravel, to enforce a consistent, PSR-12 compliant code style across the entire project.

### **Implementation Steps**

1.  **Confirm Pint Installation:**
    *   Laravel Pint is included by default as a `require-dev` dependency in modern Laravel projects. Verify its presence in `composer.json`.
    *   If it is missing for any reason, install it:
        ```bash
        composer require --dev laravel/pint
        ```

2.  **Create `pint.json` Configuration File:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a new file named `pint.json`.
    *   This file will define the code style preset to be used. The `laravel` preset is a superset of PSR-12 and includes additional conventions favored by the Laravel community.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        touch pint.json
        ```
    *   **Content for `pint.json`:**
        ```json
        {
            "preset": "laravel"
        }
        ```

3.  **Perform Initial Code Style Fix:**
    *   Run Pint on the entire project to format all existing PHP files according to the `laravel` preset. This will establish a clean baseline.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        ./vendor/bin/pint
        ```
    *   Review the changes made by Pint using `git status` and `git diff`. Commit the formatted files.

4.  **Document Usage:**
    *   Update the project's `README.md` or create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` (as per REQ-010) to include instructions for using Pint.
    *   **For checking style (e.g., in CI):**
        ```bash
        ./vendor/bin/pint --test
        ```
    *   **For fixing style locally:**
        ```bash
        ./vendor/bin/pint
        ```

### **Verification**

1.  The `pint.json` file exists in the project root with the correct content.
2.  Running `./vendor/bin/pint --test` on the freshly formatted codebase returns a successful exit code with no errors.
3.  Intentionally mis-formatting a PHP file (e.g., by changing indentation) and running `./vendor/bin/pint --test` results in a failed exit code and an error message indicating the file that needs fixing.
4.  Running `./vendor/bin/pint` on the mis-formatted file corrects the style automatically.

### **Risks and Mitigation**

*   **Risk:** A developer commits code that does not adhere to the project's code style.
    *   **Mitigation:** This risk is mitigated by the CI pipeline (REQ-007), which will run `./vendor/bin/pint --test` on every pull request, blocking any non-compliant code from being merged. Documenting the local usage encourages developers to fix styles before committing.
