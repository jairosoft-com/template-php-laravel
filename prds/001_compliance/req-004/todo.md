# TODO for REQ-004: Configure Laravel Pint

Based on the technical implementation details in `req-004.md`, the following tasks need to be completed:

- [x] **Task 1: Confirm Pint Installation**
  - Action: Check `composer.json` to ensure `laravel/pint` is a dev dependency. Install if missing.

- [x] **Task 2: Create `pint.json` Configuration File**
  - Action: Create a `pint.json` file in the project root with the `laravel` preset.

- [x] **Task 3: Perform Initial Code Style Fix**
  - Action: Run Pint to format the entire existing codebase to establish a clean baseline.
  - Command: `./vendor/bin/pint`

- [x] **Task 4: Document Usage**
  - Action: Add instructions for running Pint to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. (This will be fully completed once REQ-010 is done).
