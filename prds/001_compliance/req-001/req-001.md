# **Technical Implementation Details: REQ-001**

## **Requirement: Create `src/` Directory and Configure Autoloading**

> **User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have a `src/` directory for domain logic so that the codebase is organized by business capability.

---

### **Objective**

To establish the foundational directory structure for a Domain-Oriented Architecture by creating a `src/` directory and configuring the Composer autoloader to recognize the new `Domain\` namespace.

### **Implementation Steps**

1.  **Create `src/` Directory:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a new directory named `src`.
    *   This directory will house all core business logic, organized by domain.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        mkdir src
        ```

2.  **Update `composer.json` for PSR-4 Autoloading:**
    *   Open the `composer.json` file in the project root.
    *   Locate the `autoload` -> `psr-4` section.
    *   Add a new entry to map the `Domain\` namespace to the `src/` directory. The `App\` namespace should remain untouched.

    *   **Modification in `composer.json`:**
        ```json
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
                "App\": "app/",
                "Domain\": "src/",
                "Database\Factories\": "database/factories/",
                "Database\Seeders\": "database/seeders/"
            }
        },
        ```

3.  **Update Composer Autoloader:**
    *   Run the following Composer command to regenerate the autoloader files. This makes the new `Domain\` namespace available throughout the application.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        composer dump-autoload
        ```

4.  **Create Initial Domain Structure (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To ensure the `src` directory is committed to version control and to establish a pattern, create a `Shared` domain. This domain is intended for code that is genuinely cross-cutting and used by multiple other domains.
    *   **Commands:**
        ```bash
        mkdir src/Shared
        touch src/Shared/.gitkeep
        ```

### **Verification**

1.  Confirm that the `src/` directory exists in the project root.
2.  Inspect the `composer.json` file to ensure the `"Domain\": "src/"` entry is present under `autoload.psr-4`.
3.  After running `composer dump-autoload`, check the `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` file. It should contain a line similar to: `'Domain\' => array($baseDir . '/src'),`.
4.  Create a temporary test class within `src/Shared/Test.php` with namespace `Domain
Shared` and attempt to instantiate it from a temporary route or command to confirm it autoloads correctly.

### **Risks and Mitigation**

*   **Risk:** Incorrectly modifying `composer.json` could break the application's autoloading.
    *   **Mitigation:** Follow the JSON structure carefully. Run `composer dump-autoload` and test a class from the new namespace to verify correctness immediately after the change.
