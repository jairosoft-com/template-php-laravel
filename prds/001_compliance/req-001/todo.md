# TODO for REQ-001: Create `src/` Directory and Configure Autoloading

Based on the technical implementation details in `req-001.md`, the following tasks need to be completed:

- [x] **Task 1: Create `src/` Directory**
  - Action: In the root of the project, create a new directory named `src`.
  - Command: `mkdir src`

- [x] **Task 2: Update `composer.json` for PSR-4 Autoloading**
  - Action: Open `composer.json` and add a new entry to the `autoload.psr-4` section to map the `Domain\` namespace to the `src/` directory.

- [x] **Task 3: Update Composer Autoloader**
  - Action: Run the Composer command to regenerate the autoloader files.
  - Command: `composer dump-autoload`

- [x] **Task 4: Create Initial Domain Structure**
  - Action: Create a `Shared` domain within `src` to establish the pattern and ensure the directory is tracked by Git.
  - Commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir src/Shared
    touch src/Shared/.gitkeep
    ```
