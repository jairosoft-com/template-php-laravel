### **2. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the business requirements for a comprehensive overhaul of the `hello-world` Laravel project. The goal is to refactor the existing application to bring it into full compliance with the modern architectural, quality, and security standards defined in the `Laravel_Project.md` specification. This initiative will address significant technical debt, improve long-term maintainability, and establish a robust, automated quality assurance pipeline, thereby increasing development velocity and reducing future risks.

---

### **3. Project Overview & Background**

*   **3.1 Business Problem:** The current project codebase does not adhere to the new company-wide standards for modern Laravel applications. It follows a default framework structure that is not optimized for scalability, lacks automated code quality and static analysis tooling, and uses outdated dependencies. This misalignment introduces business risks, including slower onboarding for new developers, higher potential for bugs, and increased difficulty in maintaining and extending the application over time.
*   **3.2 Strategic Fit:** This project directly supports the strategic initiative to standardize development practices across the organization. By aligning this application with the modern template, we enhance its long-term viability, improve developer and AI-contributor productivity, and create a more secure and stable platform. This effort is a direct investment in reducing technical debt and de-risking future development.

### **4. Business Objectives & Success Metrics**

| Objective ID | Business Objective (SMART Goal)                                       | Key Performance Indicator (KPI)                                                              | Target                               |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| OBJ-01       | Achieve full compliance with the specified domain-oriented architecture by the end of the project. | 100% of core business logic is migrated to the `src/` directory, organized by domain.       | End of Project                       |
| OBJ-02       | Implement a fully automated quality assurance (QA) pipeline by the end of the project. | The CI pipeline (Lint, Static Analysis, Tests) must pass on 100% of pull requests to `main`. | End of Project                       |
| OBJ-03       | Modernize the core technology stack to the specified versions within the project timeline. | `composer.json` reflects PHP 8.3 and Laravel 12 as the required versions.                   | End of Project                       |

### **7. Business Requirements**

*Requirements are prioritized using the MoSCoW method: (M)ust Have, (S)hould Have, (C)ould Have, (W)on't Have this time.*

#### **Feature Area 1: Architectural Refactoring**

| Req. ID | Priority | User Story                                                                                                                            |
| :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REQ-001 | M        | As a developer, I want the project to have a `src/` directory for domain logic so that the codebase is organized by business capability. |
| REQ-002 | M        | As a developer, I want controllers to be "skinny" by moving all business logic into Action or Service classes within the Domain Layer. |
| REQ-003 | S        | As a developer, I want to use Form Request classes for all `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` validation so that validation is centralized and reusable. |

*   **REQ-001 Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   **AC-001.1: Scenario:** Verify new directory structure
        *   **Given** I have cloned the project repository
        *   **When** I list the contents of the root directory
        *   **Then** a `src/` directory exists
        *   **And** the `composer.json` file has a PSR-4 autoload entry for the `Domain\` namespace pointing to `src/`.

#### **Feature Area 2: Tooling & Automation**

| Req. ID | Priority | User Story                                                                                                                            |
| :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REQ-004 | M        | As a developer, I want Laravel Pint configured with a `pint.json` file so that all code is automatically formatted to the PSR-12 standard. |
| REQ-005 | M        | As a developer, I want Larastan configured with a `phpstan.neon.dist` file (level 5) so that static analysis can find potential bugs.    |
| REQ-006 | M        | As a developer, I want the project's testing framework to be Pest so that tests are more readable and expressive.                       |
| REQ-007 | M        | As a developer, I want a GitHub Actions CI pipeline that runs Pint, Larastan, and Pest so that code quality is automatically enforced.   |

*   **REQ-007 Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   **AC-007.1: Scenario:** CI pipeline runs on pull request
        *   **Given** I have opened a new pull request against the `main` branch
        *   **When** the GitHub Action is triggered
        *   **Then** three jobs are executed: `lint`, `analyse`, and `test`.
        *   **And** the pull request is blocked from merging if any job fails.

#### **Feature Area 3: Dependency Management**

| Req. ID | Priority | User Story                                                                                                                            |

| REQ-008 | M        | As a developer, I want the project's `composer.json` file updated to require PHP `8.3` and Laravel `12.x` so that it uses modern versions. |
| REQ-009 | S        | As a developer, I want the core packages (`laravel-debugbar`, `laravel-ide-helper`, `laravel-permission`, `laravel-data`, `dedoc/scramble`) installed. |

#### **Feature Area 4: Project Governance**

| Req. ID | Priority | User Story                                                                                                                            |
| :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REQ-010 | M        | As a new contributor, I want a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root directory so that I can quickly understand the development workflow and quality standards. |
